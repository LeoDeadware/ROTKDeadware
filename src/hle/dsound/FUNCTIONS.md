# DSOUND section (XDK 5028) — HLE coverage

> The table below is the donor's (HP2, XDK 5028). This XBE's entries are in the dispatch table
> of `dsound.cpp`; the gain-related ones read for this title are in "This title" at the end.

Section `DSOUND` 0x1444E0..0x14E404, 352 lifted entries (`dsound_entries.inc`).
Only 24 are called from outside the section (Ghidra caller lists of `.text`,
`XMV`; `PlayMovie` 0x18D40). All 24 are replaced; every other entry is
guarded (logs once + runs the original; `ROTK_DSOUND_STRICT=1` stops), except the
4 CRT static initialisers listed in the XBE initialiser table at 0x18E720.

Identification: each public entry is a stdcall C wrapper that converts the
interface pointer to the C++ object (`-8` = CDirectSound, `-0x1C` =
CDirectSoundBuffer) and calls the method; names come from argument count
(`ret N`), the method body and the callers' use. Confidence: H = body + callers
unambiguous, M = consistent but not proven. XbSymbolDatabase 5028 OOVPAs not
matched byte-wise yet (TODO; names agree with the XDK API).

Internal, read for behaviour: 0x13FFBC settings ctor (mixbin headroom 1 for bins 0..30, 0 for 31),
0x1418EF → 0x141460 writes it to NV1BA0_PIO_SET_SUBMIX_HEADROOM, 0x141429 HRTF headroom 0;
the GP effects image 0x169668 (0x35D0 bytes) is copied by 0x140D29 (0x14513A writes GP scratch) and its code decrypted
in place by 0x140ABC (0x1452E0 / 0x14523A keystream, key "12345678"); GP executive 0x146FB8 (0x5CC bytes, loaded by
0x140A47) DMAs bins FL C FR BL BR LFE to the EP; EP image loaded by 0x1469D5: boot 0x1E6300, chunks 0x146825
(0x1ECE08 mono / 0x1ED0F8 stereo downmix), config block 0x1ED420.
